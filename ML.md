What is Machine Learning (ML)?
Definition

Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

In simple words:

Instead of writing rules manually, we give data to the machine and it learns patterns automatically.

Why Machine Learning?

Traditional Programming:

Input + Rules → Output

Machine Learning:

Input + Output → Machine learns Rules

ML is useful when:

Rules are complex

Data is large

Patterns are difficult to write manually

Example:

Email spam detection

Face recognition

Recommendation systems

Chatbots

Types of Machine Learning
1. Supervised Learning

The model is trained using labeled data (input + correct output).

Example:

Predicting salary (Regression)

Predicting pass/fail (Classification)

Two main types:

Regression

Used when output is continuous (numbers).

Example:

House price prediction

Salary prediction

Algorithms:

Linear Regression

Polynomial Regression

Classification

Used when output is categorical (Yes/No, 0/1).

Example:

Spam detection

Disease prediction

Algorithms:

Logistic Regression

KNN

Decision Tree

Random Forest

SVM

Naive Bayes

2. Unsupervised Learning

The model is trained using data without labels.

The system tries to find hidden patterns.

Example:

Customer segmentation

Market grouping

Algorithms:

K-Means

K-Medoids

Hierarchical Clustering

DBSCAN

3. Reinforcement Learning

The model learns by interacting with the environment using rewards and penalties.

Example:

Self-driving cars

Game playing AI

Important ML Terminologies
1. Dataset

Collection of data used to train the model.

2. Features (X)

Input variables used to make predictions.

Example:
Age, Salary

3. Target (y)

Output variable we want to predict.

Example:
Purchased (Yes/No)

4. Training Data

Data used to train the model.

5. Testing Data

Data used to evaluate model performance.

6. Overfitting

When model performs well on training data but poorly on new data.

7. Underfitting

When model fails to learn patterns properly.

8. Accuracy

Percentage of correct predictions.

9. Feature Scaling

Process of normalizing data so all features are on similar scale.

Basic ML Workflow

Collect Data

Clean Data

Split Data (Train/Test)

Train Model

Evaluate Model

Improve Model

Deploy Model

Real-Life Example

Suppose we want to predict if a person will buy a product.

Input Features:

Age

Salary

Target:

Purchased (0 or 1)

Steps:

Prepare dataset

Split data

Train classification model

Check accuracy

Conclusion

Machine Learning allows systems to:

Learn from data

Identify patterns

Make predictions

Improve over time

It is widely used in:

Healthcare

Finance

E-commerce

AI systems
