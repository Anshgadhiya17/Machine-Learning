# What is Machine Learning (ML)?

## Definition

Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

### In simple words:

> Instead of writing rules manually, we give data to the machine and it learns patterns automatically.

---

## Why Machine Learning?

### Traditional Programming

Input + Rules → Output

### Machine Learning

Input + Output → Machine learns Rules

### ML is useful when:

- Rules are complex
- Data is large
- Patterns are difficult to write manually

### Examples

- Email spam detection
- Face recognition
- Recommendation systems
- Chatbots

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning

The model is trained using labeled data (input + correct output).

#### Regression
Used when output is continuous (numbers).

Examples:
- House price prediction
- Salary prediction

#### Classification
Used when output is categorical (Yes/No, 0/1).

Examples:
- Spam detection
- Disease prediction

---

### 2. Unsupervised Learning

The model is trained using data without labels.

Examples:
- Customer segmentation
- Market grouping

---

### 3. Reinforcement Learning

The model learns using rewards and penalties.

Examples:
- Self-driving cars
- Game playing AI

## Important ML Terminologies

- **Dataset** – Collection of data used to train the model
- **Features (X)** – Input variables
- **Target (y)** – Output variable
- **Training Data** – Data used to train the model
- **Testing Data** – Data used to evaluate performance
- **Overfitting** – Model performs well on training data but poorly on new data
- **Underfitting** – Model fails to learn properly
- **Accuracy** – Percentage of correct predictions
- **Feature Scaling** – Normalizing data to similar scale

## Basic ML Workflow

1. Collect Data  
2. Clean Data  
3. Split Data  
4. Train Model  
5. Evaluate Model  
6. Improve Model  
7. Deploy Model

## Conclusion

Machine Learning allows systems to:

- Learn from data
- Identify patterns
- Make predictions
- Improve over time
